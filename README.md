# Constrained Horn Clause (CHC) Reasoner: 
A simple forward chaining algorithm implementation.

<p align="justify">
1) Forward Chaining: Given a knowledge base that contains rules and facts, a forward-chaining algorithm uses these facts for the matching and firing of existing rules. A rule matching criteria is to unify premises with existing and entailed facts, if all premises of a rule hold,  a consequence of the rule gets added to the entailed facts.

## Build
Run commands on Terminal:
0. Setup Virtual Environment: `sudo apt-get install python3-venv`
1. Build: `./tool-setup`
   * Continue? [Y]es/[N]o: Y 
   * only required once to setup the reasoner
   
## Test
1. Enable execution: `source env/bin/activate`
   * Required before executing the tool on a new terminal.  
2. Run: `./src/Driver.py --help`
3. Disable execution: `deactivate`
    
## Usage

A default example file is added to test the reasoner (fwd-chaining-eg.txt). 
`./src/Driver.py`
